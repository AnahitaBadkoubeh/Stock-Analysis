# Stock Analysis Project

Using Python to uncover insights into stocks' performance, volatility, and market dynamics.
This repository contains a Stock Financial Analysis Project to evaluate three major healthcare and pharmaceutical stocks—Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)—to assess their market behavior, risk, and return characteristics using key financial metrics and models.

## Project Overview

This project explores several key financial concepts:

- Multi Ticker Annualized Historical Stock's Return
- Multi Ticker Moving Averages: Used to smooth stock price data and identify trends. Calculated simple moving averages (SMA) for 20, 50, and 200 days to observe longer-term trends and volatility for each stock.
- Multi Ticker Trade Volume and Market Capitalization Trend: Analyzed to determine each stock's market presence and trading activity.
- Matrix Correlation and Daily Returns: Measured stock correlations and daily returns to understand market relationships and diversification benefits.
- Beta: Stock's volatility relative to the overall market.
- Alpha: Stock's performance on a risk-adjusted basis.
- Multi Ticker Capital Asset Pricing Model: Applied to calculate each stock’s risk-adjusted returns based on the stock's volatility relative to the overall market and performance on a risk-adjusted basis with a Risk-Free Rate of 3% on the chosen date.

- Multi Ticker ROI Comparison
- Multi Ticker Profit/Loss Comparison
